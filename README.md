# agent-passport-go

Go SDK for the Agent Passport System (APS): protocol primitives for verifiable
agent identity, scoped delegation, signed receipts, and content-addressed
request identity. It both verifies APS artifacts and, as of this release, issues
and signs them, on RFC 8785 JCS canonical bytes and Ed25519.

**Status:** `v0.7.0`. Issuing and signing are present (Waves 2
and 3). The earlier line was verify-only; that is no longer the case.
v0.3.0 adds ComputeActionRefScopes and CanonicalizeScopes: the spec 4.1
scopeRequired canonicalization (NFC per scope string, Unicode code-point
sort) with cross-implementation vectors against the TS reference.

## Capabilities

Verify-side (no private keys needed, the verify path never compiles in key code):

- **jcs** - RFC 8785 JSON canonicalization, the signed-bytes preimage.
- **actionref** - content-addressed `action_ref` over the intent fields.
- **verify** - Ed25519 signature checks, delegation-chain monotonic narrowing,
  the scope matcher.

Issuing and signing (Waves 2+3):

- **keys / keystore** - the Ed25519 signing core: generate keypairs, sign, derive
  public keys, and an in-memory key-storage backend.
- **passport** - create, sign, countersign, and verify agent passports, plus
  challenge/response.
- **delegation** - create a delegation, sub-delegate with monotonic narrowing,
  and create/verify a signed revocation record.
- **completion** - create and verify completion receipts, link a permit to a
  completion.
- **attribution** - the beneficiary-attribution primitives: hash a receipt, build
  a Merkle root, generate and verify Merkle proofs, trace a beneficiary. The
  trace reports two distinct claims: `resolved` (lookup only, no cryptographic
  claim) and `verified` (real ed25519 verification of the receipt signature and
  every delegation hop). `TraceDelegation` carries the full canonical delegation
  preimage (signature, scope, timestamps, depth) so a hop can be verified.
- **values** - values-floor: load, attest, verify an attestation, evaluate
  compliance, resolve an enforcement mode.
- **coordination** - signed-message create/verify pairs (task brief, assign,
  accept, evidence, review, handoff, deliverable, completion).
- **commerce** - the commerce gate predicates, commerce-scope check, sign/verify
  a commerce receipt, create a commerce delegation, extract a delegation chain.
- **intoto** - emit and parse in-toto decision-receipt statements, compute a
  delegation-chain root.

[The verification boundary](https://github.com/agent-passport-system/agent-passport-go/blob/main/docs/verification-boundary.md) draws the authority-against-integrity line, names the surface this release classified, and records that the rest were not classified.

## Cross-implementation parity

Every primitive here is cross-checked byte-for-byte against the TypeScript
reference SDK: the JCS canonical bytes and the Ed25519 signatures are identical.
Because Ed25519 is deterministic, a Go signature over the same canonical bytes
with the same key equals the reference signature exactly. The tests assert this directly. Most signing packages (passport, completion,
attribution, delegation, intoto, values) re-run the TypeScript reference live
when `APS_TS_REPO` points at a checkout; commerce and coordination assert against
pinned reference values, which are the same TS-produced bytes by the determinism
above (see Conformance).

## What it does not do

- No gateway. No enforcement boundary, policy hosting, or any product
  intelligence.
- No analytics, scoring, or report generators. The weight-based attribution
  report generators, reputation scoring, and spend analytics are not here.
- No commerce orchestrator. The gate predicates are present; the multi-gate
  preflight orchestrator is not.
- No stateful stores. Cascade-revocation stores, task stores, and similar
  mutable global state are not here.

Those all live in the gateway, not in this protocol-primitives library. The
verify-only path (`verify`, `jcs`, `actionref`, `types`) stays key-free, so a
verify-only consumer never compiles in private-key code.

## Conformance

Validated against the shared APS conformance fixtures through a Go runner
(`aps-conformance-suite/runners/go`) that consumes the same vectors as the
TypeScript runner and imports this SDK. The current tally is whatever that runner reports on the suite commit it is pinned to, recorded there rather than written here. The runner additionally
re-signs all 10 bilateral-delegation vectors with the signing core to the
recorded reference signatures.

Most cross-impl tests re-run the reference SDK when `APS_TS_REPO` is set to an
`agent-passport-system` checkout, and skip cleanly when it is unset. Commerce and
coordination assert against pinned reference values in both states; their parity
follows from the JCS canonicalization and Ed25519 signing the other packages
re-run live.
